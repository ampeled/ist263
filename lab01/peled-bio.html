        My name is Avi Peled and I am a sophomore at Syracuse University. I am currently undecided in iSchool but plan to major in project management. Product/Project management is my greatest interest. Some accomplishments I have is working in an Italian restaurant and aftercare school program. These experiences helped me develop strong organizational skills as well as strengthen my communication skills. I am a very outgoing person who is easy to communicate. I have a family of five with two younger brothers and a dog. I'm a sports fanatic and have always loved playing basketball in my free time. I enrolled in the school to learn about the true power of data and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. I am interested in the growing amounts of available data that can be analyzed to positively impact organizations.
