                <h2>Pastabilities</h2>
                <p>
                    Pastabilities in Syracuse, NY, was fantastic. The pasta was very tasty with many different options. I would recommend the spicy vodka rigatoni as it was my favorite dish. The service was great, and the atmosphere was welcoming. I highly recommend trying their pasta if you're in the area.
