            <h2>Pastabilities</h2>
            <p>Pastabilities in Syracuse NY and it was fantastic. The pasta was very tasty and they had many different options. I would recommend the spicy vodka rigatoni as it was my favorite dish. The service was great and the atmosphere was welcoming. I highly recommend trying their pasta if you're in the area.</p>
