                <p>“Dinosaur is the very best BBQ! My daughter and I try to go every weekend. I've had several things on the menu: the brisket, green fried tomatoes, chicken wings, all the sides and everything is delicious. Honestly, I've never been disappointed. For BBQ the prices are reasonable as well. Keep up the amazing work!”</p>

                <p>“My husband and I were stopping through Syracuse, and Pastabilities was highly recommended. The food and service were fabulous. I have an onion allergy and the servers, manager, and manager/owner double-checked recipes and the chefs to ensure there were no onions. The food was delicious. I highly recommend this family-owned/women-owned restaurant in Syracuse.”</p>
